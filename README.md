# DNA-Program
Counting DNA Nucleotides 
OVERVIEW:
This program is designed to analyze a DNA sequence and count the occurrences of its four nucleotides: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Thymine (T). The tool provides an essential utility for bioinformatics and genomic analysis, enabling researchers to quantify and understand DNA composition efficiently.

FEATURES:
Counts occurrences of each nucleotide in a given DNA sequence.
Handles both upper and lower case DNA sequences.
Validates input to ensure it's a valid DNA sequence (only contains A, C, G, T characters).
Efficient and user-friendly implementation suitable for large sequences.


APPLICATIONS:
Analyzing DNA composition for genetic research.
Identifying patterns in genomic data.
Supporting advanced bioinformatics pipelines.


Example Usage:
Given the DNA sequence:
"AGCTTAGCTA"

The program will output:
A: 3  
C: 2  
G: 2  
T: 3

How It Works:
The user inputs a DNA sequence.
The program validates the input to ensure it only contains valid nucleotide characters.
The program iterates through the sequence and counts the occurrences of each nucleotide.
The results are displayed or saved for further analysis.
